<p align="center">Hi, thanks for checking out my website. I’m Maria Claydon, an aspiring developer with a passion for technology. 
Currently living and working in Perth, Western Australia.
</p>
<p align="center">In June 2022 I completed a coding scholarship with She Codes Australia as part of the She Codes Plus Perth 2021 Cohort. 
A fantastic initiative aiming to bridge the gap for women in the tech industry. I am very grateful to have been selected to learn to code 
with mentors from the tech industry alongside some amazing women. You can hear more about my coding journey in my blog. My favourite languages 
that I have learned so far are Javascript and Python. My favourite project was our Group Project and my favourite framework has been React. 
Here are some of my projects: https://mariapetra.github.io/projects.html
</p>
<p align="center">I am happiest when I am solving problems, helping other people and learning new concepts. All things that drew me to Technology. 
I have had a great career in Technology so far that I will bring with me to a Developer role. Working in Business Analysis, Project Management, 
Partnership Management, Technical Support and Implementations along with other responsibilities.
</p>
<p align="center">I am also very creative and have a background in Fine Art, I completed my degree at the University of Reading in the UK and won 
an award in my final year for drawing. My creative side helps me tremendously when I’m coding and looking at problems to solve. In my spare time 
I love drinking chai, long brunches with friends and getting outdoors whenever I can in this beautiful part of the world swimming, hiking and 
camping. Thank you for reading my bio. If you want to know more then please get in touch via the contact form on my website https://mariapetra.github.io/contact.html.
